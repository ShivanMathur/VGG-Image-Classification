# VGG-Image-Classification
The project's objective is to utilize the VGG-13 architecture to classify images within a dataset consisting of three categories: Dogs, Cars, and Food.

### Implementation:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Implemented a data preprocessing pipeline that included extracting, normalizing, and transforming the dataset, ensuring images were converted to a consistent format and scale for optimal model performance.
- **Model Architecture:** Implemented VGG-13 architecture, featuring 10 convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation, followed by max-pooling layers. The model's fully connected network (FCN) consists of two dense layers with 4096 units each, leading to a final output layer tailored for the 3-class classification task. The architecture was optimized using the Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss, ensuring efficient training and robust performance across the dataset.
